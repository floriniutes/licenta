# Thesis project

Web application created to help the citizens or the doctors to easily manage their appointments, offer them a notification system and a history of every completed consultation.
System Requirements:
    NodeJS
    ReactJS
    MySQL Database
In order to start the app: 
•	Go into the backend folder 
•	Open the git terminal and install the modules using the "npm i" 
•	Start the server by using "node server.js"
•	Go into the frontend folder
•	Open the git terminal and install the modules using the "npm i" 
•	Start the app by using "npm run dev"

To get a proper glimpse at how this application works, you would have to insert multiple records into the database. In order to save some time, I offered a couple of screenshots.
