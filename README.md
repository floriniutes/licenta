# Thesis project

Web application created to help the citizens or the doctors to easily manage their appointments, offer them a notification system and a history of every completed consultation.

**System Requirements:**

    NodeJS
    
    ReactJS
    
    MySQL Database
    
**Steps to start the app:**

    1. Go into the backend folder

    2. Open the git terminal and install the modules using the "npm i" 

    3. Start the server by using "node server.js"

    4. Go into the frontend folder
    
    5. Open the git terminal and install the modules using the "npm i" 

    6. Start the app by using "npm run dev"
    
The frontend runs on port 8080, while the backend uses port 8081

**After you've completed the steps above, access the app by using http://localhost:8080/**

To get a proper glimpse at how this application works, you would have to insert multiple records into the database. In order to save some time, I offered a couple of screenshots.
